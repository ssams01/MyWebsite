            <h2>Fantasy Travel App</h2>
            <p> Fantasy Travel was a project I worked on at my last job opportunity where I had the pleasure of working with 
                3 nice and talented people.  The program is designed to be like a travel site that gives information such as,
                weather and a short description of the travel destination, but for places from say Star Wars for example. It is 
                C#/.NET based that used a DB that was hosted on Azure and ADO.NET to send data back and forth. It used the National
                Weather Service's public API to gather the weather information we needed.

            <h2>Lit - Book API</h2>
            <p>Lit the Book API was another project I had the pleasure of working on at Revature, though this time with a group of 8
                people!  Here me and my team, took a pre-existing application and added/changed the project to meet our needs. So what 
                we ended up doing was added a more complete backend that utilized EF Core instead of ADO.NET this time to communicate with
                a DB instance, and a Angular based frontend was created.

            <h2>MyWebsite</h2>
            <p>This website was made using Angular, HTML/CSS and Typescript.  The reason I decided to create it was, to demonstrate
               my ability to create an Angular project outside the context of a group project, as well as with the hopes to get more
               experience and improve my HTML and CSS skills.
