!!! Make sure you have some sort of IDE installed on your computer first, I would recommend Visual Studio Code : https://code.visualstudio.com/download !!!

1. Clone the repo using "git clone" followed by the string you copy by: a) clicking "Code" on the repository and copy to clipboard and  b) then right-click and paste into your terminal

2. Run these commands on your terminal to make sure you have the proper dependencies installed to run the program : a) npm install and b) npm install -g @angular/cli

3. Navigate to the "StephenSams" folder (This is where the Angular app is) -- "cd StephenSams"

4. Do "ng serve" (you can optionally do --port to specify which port you want to run the temporary server on, ex: "ng serve --port 4201")
