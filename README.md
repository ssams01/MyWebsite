# MyWebsite
An Angular Project designed to act as a personal website.

#instructions on how to view:

1. Clone the repo using "git clone" followed by the string you copy by clicking "Code" on the repository and copy to clipboard and then right-click and paste into your terminal

2. Run the commands to make sure you have the proper dependencies : npm install, npm install -g @angular/cli

3. Navigate to the "StephenSams" folder -- "cd StephenSams"

4. Do "ng serve" (you can optionally do --port to specify which port you want to run the temporary server on)

5. Click link on the console

*I am hoping to one day have this hosted on either Azure or AWS.
